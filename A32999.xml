            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ANd Ieſus ſeeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain; and when he was ſet, his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came unto him. And he opened his mouth and taught them, ſaying, Bleſſed are the poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Bleſſed are they that mourn: for they ſhall be comforted. Bleſſed are the meek: for they ſhall inherit the earth. Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs: for they ſhall be filled. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the merciful: for they ſhall obtain mercy. Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee God. Bleſſed are the peace-makers: for they ſhall be called the children of God. Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake: Rejoyce and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the prophets which were before you.</p>
               <p>I Believe in one God, the Father Almighty, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of heaven and earth, and of all things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible:</p>
               <p>And in one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, begotten of his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one ſubſtance with the Father, by whom all things were made: who for us men, and for our ſalvation, came down from heaven,
<pb facs="tcp:99776:22"/> and was incarnate by the holy Ghoſt of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was made man, and was crucified alſo for us under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> He ſuffered, and was buried, and the third day he roſe again, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, and aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſitteth on the right hand of the Father. And he ſhall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: whoſe kingdom ſhall have no end.</p>
               <p>And I believe in the holy Ghoſt, the Lord and giver of life, who procéedeth from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worſhipped and glorified, who ſpake by the Prophets. And I believe one Catholick and Apoſtolick Church. I acknowledge one Baptiſm for the remiſſion of ſins. And I look for the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

               <head>The ſecond Leſſon is, Hebrews 11.</head>
               <p>NOw faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we underſtand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen, were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice then Cain, by which he obtained witneſs that he was righteous, God teſtifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead, yet ſpeaketh. By faith Enoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him: for before his tranſlation, he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God. But without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe him; for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him. By
<pb facs="tcp:99776:29"/> faith Noah, being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the ſaving of his houſe, by the which he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world, and became heir of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is by faith. By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange countrey, dwelling in tabernacles with Iſaat and Iacob, the heirs with him of the ſame promiſe. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God. Through faith alſo Sara her ſelf received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, and was delivered of a child, when ſhe was paſt age, becauſe ſhe judged him faithful who had promiſed. Therefore ſprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, ſo many as the ſtars of the ſky in multitude, and as the ſand which is by the ſea-ſhore innumerable. Theſe all died in faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers, and pilgrims on the earth. For they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a countrey. And truly, if they had been mindful of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned: But now they deſire a better countrey, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Iſaat: and he that had received the promiſes, offered up
<pb facs="tcp:99776:29"/> his only begotten ſon, Of whom it was ſaid, that in Iſaat ſhall thy ſeed be called: Accounting that God was able to raiſe him up, even from the dead: from whence alſo he received him in a figure. By faith Iſaat bleſſed Iacob, and Eſau concerning things to come. By faith Iacob, when he was a dying, bleſſed both the ſons of Ioſeph, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped leaning upon the top of his ſtaff. By faith Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, when he died, made mention of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the children of Iſrael, and gave command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning his bones. By faith Moſes, when he was born, was hid three moneths of his parents, becauſe they ſaw he was a proper child, and they not afraid of the kings commandment. By faith Moſes, when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daughter, Chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Egypt; for he had reſpect unto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of the reward. By faith he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible. Through faith he kept the paſſeover and the ſprinkling of blood, leſt he that deſtroyed the firſt-born ſhould touch them. By faith they paſſed thorow the Red-ſea, as by dry land: which the Egptians aſſaying to do, were drowned. By faith the walls of Iericho fell down, after they were compaſſed about ſeven days. By faith the harlot Rahab periſhed not with them that believed not, when ſhe had received the ſpies with peace. And what ſhall I more ſay? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak,
<pb facs="tcp:99776:30"/> and of Samſon, and of Iephtha, of David alſo, and Samuel, and of the prophets: Who through faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens: Women received their dead, raiſed to life again: and others were tortured, not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection. And others had trial of cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſcourgings; yea, moreover of bonds and impriſonment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawen aſunder, were tempted, were ſtain with the ſword: they wandered about in ſhéep-ſkins, and goat-ſkins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: (Of whom the world was not worthy) they wandred in deſerts, and in mountains, and in dens, and caves of the earth. And theſe all having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promiſe; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided ſome better thing for us: that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</p>

Spare us therefore, good Lord, ſpare thy people whom thou haſt redeemed; enter not into judgement with thy ſervants, who are vile earth, and miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but ſo turn thine anger from us, who meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge our vileneſs, and truly repent us of our faults; and ſo make vaſte to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
